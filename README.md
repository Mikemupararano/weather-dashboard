# Weather-dashboard

## Description 
This web application retrieves city weather data from Open Weather and displays wind speed, temperature, humidity and UV index. The weather data for the searched city is for the current day and then weather data for the next five days.

The user will type the name of a city they want to get weather data for and the web application will return the results as shown in the screenshots for Harare, London, Paris and Havana. 

The web application has been designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery and Google Fonts and Day.js. 

I built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I used the 5-Day Weather Forecast API and linked my application to this external site and retrieved weather data for cities.
The weather application meets the following criteria:
(1) When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

(2) When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
(a) The city name
(b) The date
(c) An icon representation of weather conditions
(d) The temperature
(e) The humidity
(f) The wind speed
